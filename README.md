In Saudi Arabia, the coffee industry is expanding, especially in Riyadh being the capital of the Kingdom. Coffee becomes a daily necessity for most of people from various society levels. People are seeking a cozy place to have a relaxing time, meet friends or enjoy a family gathering. Also, it is common behavior among students and workers to grape a cup of coffee of their favorite flavor from the nearest Café in the mornings. Saudi people like and enjoy the western style coffee shops making this type of business successful.  
However, the right place for a café is crucial for the business success. Some metrics needs to be considered in order to choose the right place to open the new café. 
 
In this study, I gathered the necessary data from multiple sources to achieve the study’s objective. After data cleansing and preprocessing, I did explore and perform some analysis on the data to come up with the best five Riyadh neighborhoods for a new café. 
 
The project will be interesting for anyone interested to open a coffee shop in Riyadh. It will provide the business owner with the top five recommended districts to open the café. Moreover, the project will be helpful for people interested in opening a restaurant having similar criteria to the ones studied here.
